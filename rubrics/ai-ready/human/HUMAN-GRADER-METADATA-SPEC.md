# AI-Readiness — Human Grader Metadata Spec

The packet a reviewer receives, so they never touch the raw RO-Crate. For each
questionnaire item it lists **exactly which fields to extract and display**, and
where they come from. Field names are the crate/EVI properties (and the LLM
grader's `extractor_inputs` keys) so the same extractor can feed both the human
packet and the LLM.

**Conventions**
- *Root* = the root Dataset entity of the crate. *Entities* = the `@graph` items.
- "TABULAR-scoped" = compute over datasets whose format is tabular
  (CSV/TSV/Parquet/H5AD/JSONL/XLSX/Arrow/…); exclude images, vendor binaries,
  BAM/FASTQ, audio. Show the reviewer both the tabular count and the
  non-tabular count so they apply the scope correctly.
- **Render each field as**: the value if present, or an explicit `— (absent)`
  so "missing" is visible rather than silently blank.
- Fields marked **⚠ N/A-flag** should carry a note when the dataset type makes
  them inapplicable (e.g. consent for non-human-subjects data, tabular stats for
  an all-imaging crate), so the reviewer marks N/A rather than 0.

## Packet — Section 0 · FAIRness

### Q0.1 Findable & accessible
| Field to serve | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `root_identifier` | root `identifier`/`@id` | the PID string; flag whether it looks like DOI/ARK/Handle/PURL/w3id/URN/RRID/SWHID |
| `publisher_info` | root `publisher` | object or string |
| `archive_indicators` | publisher / distribution / description | list of recognized repo names/hosts found (dataverse, zenodo, physionet, fairhub, biostudies, dbgap, geo…) |
| `context_namespaces` | `@context` | the vocab namespaces declared |
| `recognized_vocabularies` | derived from `@context` | schema.org / DCAT / EVI / Croissant detected |
| `confidentiality_level` | root `confidentialityLevel` | needed to judge metadata-open-vs-data-restricted |
| `conditions_of_access` | root `conditionsOfAccess` | |

### Q0.2 Interoperable & reusable
| Field to serve | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tabular_dataset_count` / `non_tabular_dataset_count` | derived | scope denominator + excluded count |
| `datasets_with_schema_count` | derived | of tabular datasets, how many link a Schema (`evi:schema`/`conformsTo`/`schema`) |
| `formats_with_published_spec_count` | dataset `format`/`encodingFormat` | count in CSV/Parquet/JSON/HDF5/NIfTI/BAM/FASTQ/Zarr/std image/audio |
| `format_distribution` | dataset formats | counts by format, so the reviewer sees the mix |
| `license_value` | root `license` | URL / SPDX / text |
| `license_is_resolvable` | derived | URL or recognized SPDX vs free-text |
| `license_is_cc0` | derived | **⚠ flag** — CC0 discouraged for biomedical |
| `conditions_of_access` | root `conditionsOfAccess` | DUA narrative may substitute for a license |
| `prohibited_uses` | root `prohibitedUses` | |

## Packet — Section 1 · Provenance

**Section 1 is NOT served as a field table.** Provenance is inherently a graph,
so the reviewer gets **two deliverables** instead:

1. **Author / PI / contributors list** — a short table of the people and
   organizations credited on the dataset, with identifiers, for Q1.1's "actors"
   half.
2. **Interactive evidence graph** — the provenance visualization
   (`provenance-graph.html`, as produced by the nf-fairscape / FAIRSCAPE
   EvidenceGraph exporter; example:
   `NewMoniWork/nf/nf-fairscape/examples/letters-chain/results/provenance-graph.html`).
   The reviewer walks the graph and clicks each node's **ℹ** info button to read
   that entity's details.

> **⚠ Prerequisite — exported-HTML change required.** The **online** graph viewer
> shows a per-node **ℹ** info affordance; the **standalone exported
> `provenance-graph.html` does not yet**. The exported viewer must gain the same
> per-node info popover before this section can be graded from the HTML alone.
> The data it needs is already embedded — each node carries `_sourceData` (the
> full entity dict) plus `description`, `type`, and relations from
> `window.__EVIDENCE_GRAPH_DATA__["@graph"]`; the popover just needs to render
> them. Until then, fall back to the `computation_samples` / `software_samples`
> field tables below.

### Deliverable 1 — Author / PI / contributors list (for Q1.1)
| Field to serve | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `root_actors` | root `author`/`creator`/`contributor`/`publisher`/`principalInvestigator`/`contactPoint` | verbatim rows: name + role + identifier |
| `author_count` / `authors_with_orcid_count` | derived | ORCID coverage (judge by effort, not 100%) |
| `publisher_present` / `publisher_has_ror` | derived | **⚠ N/A-flag** — no ROR expected when publisher is a data archive |
| `principal_investigator_present` | derived | show the PI prominently — it anchors "who's responsible" |

### Deliverable 2 — Evidence graph + per-node ℹ popover (for Q1.1 sources & all of Q1.2)
The graph nodes and edges come straight from the EvidenceGraph
(`generatedBy` / `usedDataset` / `usedSoftware` / `usedSample` / `usedInstrument`).
Node fill by type: **green** = Dataset/Sample, **red** = Computation/Experiment,
**yellow** = Software/Instrument. Each node's **ℹ** popover must expose:

| Popover field | Source (per node `_sourceData`) | Supports |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | entity `name` | node identity |
| `@id` | entity `@id` (ARK/DOI) | resolvability |
| `@type` | entity `@type` (Dataset / Computation / Software…) | reading the chain |
| `description` | entity `description` | Q1.1 source specificity; Q1.2 step meaning |
| source / accession | Dataset `sourceOrganization` / `provider` / accession in name or description | **Q1.1** — origin of raw-input Datasets |
| `url` / `codeRepository` / `version` | Software entity | **Q1.2** — is the software identifiable & versioned |
| inputs / outputs | `usedDataset` / `usedSample` + `generatedBy` / `generated` | **Q1.2** — does the step declare I/O |

Supporting rollups to display alongside the graph (so the reviewer can gauge
coverage without counting nodes by hand — same values the LLM grader uses):

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `computation_count` | derived | number of processing steps (red nodes) |
| `computation_with_software_link_count` | derived | steps linking `usedSoftware` (red → yellow edges) |
| `computation_with_io_count` | derived | steps declaring both inputs and outputs |
| `software_count` / `software_with_link_count` / `software_with_version_count` | derived | identifiability + versioning coverage |
| `software_in_sustainable_archive_count` | derived | informational (Zenodo/Software Heritage) — a plus, not required |
| `computation_samples` / `software_samples` | up to 8 / 10 entities | text fallback if the ℹ popover is unavailable in the exported HTML |

## Packet — Section 3 · Pre-model Explainability

### Q3.1 Intended use & limitations (served as the rendered datasheet)
**Primary deliverable is the rendered HTML datasheet itself, not a field table.**
Hand the grader the human-readable datasheet (the `datasheet_entity` /
`associatedDocumentation` HTML) and let them read the intended-use and
limitations sections directly. The grader does **not** judge whether the
datasheet exists — that's satisfied by serving it. Existence/linkage is
confirmed upstream (deterministic check / LLM grader), not by the human.

| Item to serve | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Rendered HTML datasheet** | `datasheet_entity` (hasPart / associatedDocumentation, format html) | **the deliverable** — the grader reads this |
| `rai_dataUseCases` | root | fallback / cross-check if the datasheet doesn't foreground use cases |
| `rai_dataLimitations` | root | fallback / cross-check for limitations & out-of-scope uses |
| `prohibited_uses` | root `prohibitedUses` / additionalProperty | explicit out-of-bounds uses |
| `associated_publications` | `associatedPublication`/`citation`/`hasPart` | prior analyses / originating publication — surface as links |

*Not shown to the human anymore (used only by the upstream existence check):*
`has_human_readable_datasheet`, `populated_section_count`,
`healthsheet_fields_present`.

### Q3.2 Verifiable
| Field to serve | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `total_hashable_entities` | derived | Dataset + Software count |
| `entities_with_hash` | derived | those with `md5`/`sha256`/`contentChecksum` |
| `hash_coverage` | derived | ratio (null if 0 hashable) |
| access-mode note | derived | **⚠ N/A-flag** — embargoed/controlled entities may lack a published hash |

## Field inventory — everything the extractor must be able to produce

Root-level: `identifier`/`@id`, `publisher`, `license`, `conditionsOfAccess`,
`prohibitedUses`, `confidentialityLevel`, `deidentified`, `contactEmail`,
`description`, `keywords`, `about`/`subjectOf`, `author`/`creator`/`contributor`,
`principalInvestigator`, `contactPoint`, `conformsTo`, `hasPart`,
`humanSubjectResearch`, `informedConsent`, `atRiskPopulations`, `ethicalReview`,
`dataGovernanceCommittee`, and the `rai:*` block (`dataCollection`,
`dataCollectionMissingData`, `dataBiases`, `dataUseCases`, `dataLimitations`,
`dataReleaseMaintenancePlan`, `personalSensitiveInformation`,
`dataPreprocessingProtocol`, `dataCollectionType`).

Per-entity: `@type`, `@id`, `name`, `description`, `format`/`encodingFormat`,
`contentUrl`/`url`/`distribution`, `rowCount`/`columnCount`/`contentSize`/`sampleSize`,
`hasSummaryStatistics`, `evi:schema`/`conformsTo`/`schema`, `md5`/`sha256`/`contentChecksum`,
`version`/`versionTag`/`codeRepository`, `usedSoftware`/`usedSample`/`usedInstrument`,
`wasGeneratedBy`/`wasDerivedFrom`/`isPartOf`, `associatedPublication`/`citation`.

Derived/computed: tabular vs non-tabular partition; all the `*_count`,
`*_coverage`, and `*_density` rollups; PID / SPDX / CC0 / resolvable-URL
detectors; recognized-vocab / recognized-standard / recognized-archive
detectors; URL host + protocol extraction.

> Everything here is already computed by the LLM grader's extractor
> (`extract.py` `extractor_inputs`). The human packet is a **re-rendering** of
> the same extraction, grouped by the 17 questions instead of the 28 rubrics —
> so one extractor run can produce both the machine grade and the human packet.

### Special case — Section 1 is served as a graph, not a table
Section 1 (Provenance) is delivered as an **author/PI list + the interactive
evidence-graph HTML** rather than a field table (see its packet section above).
Two build items follow from this:
1. **Author/PI list** — render `root_actors` + ORCID/ROR coverage as a small table.
2. **Evidence graph** — ship the EvidenceGraph export (`provenance-graph.html`).
   It needs a **per-node ℹ info popover** (present in the online viewer, **not yet
   in the standalone export**) surfacing each node's `name`, `@id`, `@type`,
   `description`, source/accession, software `url`/`version`, and inputs/outputs.
   The data is already embedded in `window.__EVIDENCE_GRAPH_DATA__["@graph"]`
   (each node carries `_sourceData`); only the popover UI is missing. Track this
   as a prerequisite for grading Section 1 from the HTML.
